# Due Diligence Report Feature

This feature provides components for rendering detailed due diligence reports on companies.

## Structure

The due diligence report has been refactored into smaller, more maintainable components:

### Main Components

- `DueDiligenceReportWrapper`: Handles data fetching and loading states
- `DueDiligenceReport`: Main component that composes all sections

### Section Components

The report has been broken down into modular sections:

- `ExecutiveSummarySection`: Overview and key highlights
- `CompanyOverviewSection`: Basic company information
- `FinancialAnalysisSection`: Financial data and metrics
- `MarketAnalysisSection`: Market position and competitors
- `SwotAnalysis`: SWOT analysis component used in Market Analysis
- `RiskAssessmentSection`: Various risk factors
- `ValuationAnalysisSection`: Valuation models and metrics
- `InvestmentRecommendationsSection`: Investment advice and catalysts

### Utility Components

- `ReportSection`: Reusable wrapper for report sections
- `ReportLogo`: Logo component for branding

## Refactoring Approach

The original implementation had several issues:

1. The `DueDiligenceReport.tsx` file was very large (1000+ lines)
2. There were syntax errors in the try/catch blocks
3. The code was difficult to maintain and update

Our refactoring strategy:

1. Break down the large component into smaller, focused components
2. Each section is now its own component with proper typing
3. Components are conditionally rendered based on available data
4. Common styling patterns extracted to shared components
5. Added proper documentation with JSDoc comments
6. Created a barrel file (index.ts) for easier imports

## Usage

```tsx
// Import the wrapper to use in routes
import { DueDiligenceReportWrapper } from '../features/due-diligence/components';

// In your router
<Route path="/due-diligence/:companyId" element={<DueDiligenceReportWrapper />} />
```

For development and testing, a mock implementation is provided that works without API access.

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for each component
- Implement print styles for PDF export
- Add internationalization support
- Provide theme customization options
